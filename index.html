	<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
	<p>
	  We are Uptown Local, Columbia University’s Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team and, since
1973, we have been practicing and competing in tournaments across the country. We
strive to represent the core values of our sport and our university at the highest levels of
competition, while never losing sight of our love for the game and each other.

	<h1>What is Ultimate? </h1>
	<p>
Though in the past ultimate has been regarded as a &#39;hippy&#39; alternative sport, the modern
ultimate scene has evolved far beyond its roots. With high flying grabs, diving catches
and SportsCenter-making plays, modern ultimate frisbee hardly resembles the drunken
college pickup of old.
	</p>
	<p>
Ultimate is a team sport combining aspects of soccer, football, basketball and volleyball.
Currently, it is one of the fastest growing sports in America; there are over 14,000
members in the college division alone. Nearly every university in the US has a club
ultimate team, and there is a highly competitive championship series that culminates in a
national championship in the late spring.

	<h1>Who can Join?</h1>
	<p>
	  No experience is necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
Most incoming freshmen join the team with little to no experience with competitive
ultimate. The sport itself is young. The team is always changing. Interested players are
always welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
Anyone in the area is welcome to practice with us. To compete in tournaments, you must
be at least a part-time, degree-seeking student at Columbia and still have eligibility with
USAU, the governing body of the sport.
	</p>
	<h1>How Often is Practice?</h1>
	<p>
	  Two or three times a week at night at Baker Athletic Complex, lasting about two hours.
We take the university shuttle directly to the field. Practices in winter/early spring either
take place inside the new Baker bubble, or in the Dodge gym.

	<h1>Who do You Play? </h1>
	<p>
USAU divides the country into ten geographic regions. Each region is split up into
smaller sections. Columbia is a part of the Metro East region, which includes New York,
New Jersey, and Connecticut. We compete against colleges in these states as well as those in the New England and Ohio Valley regions.
